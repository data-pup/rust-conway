# Rust Conway's Game of Life

### Overview

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Rust. This was a chance
for me to practice learning to program in Rust some more, and learn some
features of Rust that I was not already familiar with.

Big picture concepts that I wanted to work on in this are:
*  The module system
*  Testing
*  Documenting functions and structs
